Clojure Project Euler solutions
===============================
This is a set of solutions to the first few [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, written in Clojure. The goal is for the code to be as fast and idiomatic as possible.

Usage
-----
The files are stand-alone scripts, and can be run (for instance) by using [lein-exec](https://github.com/kumarshantanu/lein-exec).

All scripts have been tested with Clojure 1.5.1.
