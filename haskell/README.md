Haskell Project Euler solutions
===============================
This is a set of solutions to the first few [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, written in Haskell.

The goal is for the code to be as fast, clear and idiomatic as possible.

The solutions have been generalised where appropriate.

Usage
-----
The individual problem files can be run either by e.g. using runhaskell or ghc.
A utility script (runopt) is provided which compiles a file with optimisations (assuming that GHC is available) and and executes it without cluttering the project directory with build files.

All files have been tested with GHC 7.6.3.
