Project Euler solutions
=======================
Solutions to the first few [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, written in various languages (okay, only Clojure and Haskell so far).

The goal is for the solutions to be as fast, clean and idiomatic as possible. The solutions have been generalised where appropriate to handle input other than that specified in the problem descriptions.
